This repository contains four files: a neural net constructor python file,
two jupyter notebooks for testing the constructor,
and an explainer detailing the use of these files.

NeuralNetConstructor.py contains the source code for neural net construction

fracking_constructor.ipynb contains an example of the constructor being used for binary classification
walnut_constructor.ipynb contains an example of the constructor being used for multiclass classification

CSI Neural Net Generator Guide contains an explanation of each parameter in the constructor as well as how it is implemented practically
